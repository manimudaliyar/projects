# Projects

This repository contains hands-on projects built while learning and practicing core DevOps.

The focus of these projects is on fundamentals, automation, and operational correctness rather than complex tooling or overengineering.

Each folder represents an independent project or tool, with its own documentation where applicable.

## Repository Structure

**bash-automation/**  
Linux automation scripts written in Bash, focusing on system monitoring, exit codes, logging, and automation-friendly behavior.

Additional projects will be added over time as part of continuous learning in areas such as containers, CI/CD and infrastructure as code.

---

## Goals

- Build a strong foundation in Linux and automation
- Write scripts and tools that are machine-consumable and production-aware
- Practice clean Git workflows and project structuring
- Maintain small, focused, and well-documented projects

---

## Notes

These projects are intentionally kept simple and focused to reflect real-world operational tasks and learning progression.
